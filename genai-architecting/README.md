## Functional Requirements  

The organization aims to take full control of its AI infrastructure to ensure data privacy and long-term cost efficiency.  
They are concerned about potential increases in the pricing of managed GenAI services and want to maintain full ownership of their system.  

The plan is to invest in an AI workstation with a budget of **$10,000 to $15,000**.  
The system will support **300 active users**, all of whom are based in **Nagasaki**.  

## Assumptions  

- The open-source LLMs selected will be capable of running efficiently on a system within the **$10Kâ€“$15K budget**.  
- A single server in the office will be connected to the internet, providing sufficient bandwidth to accommodate **300 users**.  

## Data Strategy  

- To address copyright concerns, the organization will **purchase licensed materials** and store them securely in a private database for authorized access.  

## Considerations  

- **IBM Granite** is a strong candidate for the LLM due to its fully open-source nature and **transparent training data**, reducing the risk of copyright violations.  
- Maintaining visibility into the model's training data ensures compliance with legal requirements and intellectual property regulations.
