<user:score reasons>

- BAD: no vocabulary table
- BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary
- BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because student needs to figure that out.
- BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that
conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]
